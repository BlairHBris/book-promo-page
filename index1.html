            <div>
                <strong>Chapter One-</strong>  As I sit here with one foot on either side of the ledge,
                looking down from twelve stories above the streets of Boston, I can’t
                help but think about suicide.
                <br>
                <br>
                Not my own. I like my life enough to want to see it through.
                <br>
                <br>
                I’m more focused on other people, and how they ultimately come to the
                decision to just end their own lives. Do they ever regret it? In the
                moment after letting go and the second before they make impact, there
                has to be a little bit of remorse in that brief free fall. Do they look
                at the ground as it rushes toward them and think, “Well, crap. This was
                a bad idea.”
