            Chapter One As I sit here with one foot on either side of the ledge, 
            looking down from twelve stories above the streets of Boston, I can’t 
            help but think about suicide.
            <br>
            Not my own. I like my life enough to want to see it through.
            <br>
            I’m more focused on other people, and how they ultimately come to the 
            decision to just end their own lives. Do they ever regret it? In the 
            moment after letting go and the second before they make impact, there 
            has to be a little bit of remorse in that brief free fall. Do they look 
            at the ground as it rushes toward them and think, “Well, crap. This was 
            a bad idea.”
